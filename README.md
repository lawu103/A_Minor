# A Minor

A Minor uses a recurrent neural network to generate music by using samples from an input text file. Both the input and output music is in abc notation, an ASCII-based style of recording notes in a tune. Generated abc sequences can be converted to sheet music and sound files at http://colinhume.com/music.aspx.

Current implementation, while capable of generating passable music, still requires quite some training before being able to produce songs that fully adhere to musical convention (i.e. time signature, non-repeated bars, etc).
